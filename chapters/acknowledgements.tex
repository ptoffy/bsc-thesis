\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
First and foremost, I extend my gratitude to Professor Bergamasco, whose guidance has been important throughout the journey of completing this thesis. My heartfelt appreciation also goes to Tim, who introduced me to the world of server-side Swift and still manages to teach me something new every day.

I owe a profound debt of gratitude to my parents and my family, whose emotional, financial, and all-encompassing support have been the pillars of my strength throughout my university years.

Special thanks to Ginevra, who helps me manage life when it is not so easily manageable and for being my partner in exploring new culinary horizons, whether in Bologna, Rome or New York.

I am grateful to Gabriele, for always being there to lend a hand with my thesis work, and to Luca, with whom I have shared the entirety of my university journey.

Finally, I want to thank all my friends, both in Trieste and in Venice, who I have shared so many important moments with, even if at distance.
